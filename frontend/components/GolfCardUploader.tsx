/**
 * @component GolfCardUploader
 * @description A React functional component that allows users to select and upload an image file, presumably a golf scorecard.
 * It provides a preview of the selected image and handles the upload process (currently simulated).
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Manages internal state for the selected `file`, `previewUrl`, `uploading` status, and `message` (for success/error feedback).
 * - `handleFileChange`: Validates that the selected file is an image and creates a `previewUrl` using `URL.createObjectURL()`.
 * - `handleUpload`: Simulates an upload process with a delay. In a real application, this would involve sending the file to a backend API.
 * - Displays a drag-and-drop area or a file input for image selection.
 * - Shows the image preview if a file is selected, with an option to remove it.
 * - Provides feedback messages for invalid file type, no file selected, upload success, and upload failure.
 * - Uses `next-i18next` via the `useTranslation` hook for internationalizing UI text (e.g., button labels, messages).
 * - The actual file upload to a server is not implemented yet and is marked as a placeholder.
 *
 * Called by:
 * - This component is not currently called by any other component or page in the provided codebase.
